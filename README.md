DataViRe is an easy and powerful reporting tool to automate Grafana and Kibana dashboards into comprehensive reports

- **Reports:** Create a new report by selecting your preferred data source and dashboard. Optionally, adjust the time range if different from the dashboard settings. Choose the report layout and export format to suit your needs. Next, preview your PDF report in real time and customize it using basic settings or predefined templates. Finally, set the scheduling frequency and select the distribution channel for receiving the reports. That's itâ€”your report is ready!
- **Basic Report Settings:** Personalize your reports by adding your company logo and branding colors. These customizations ensure your reports align with your brand identity.
- **Report Templates:** Design fully customizable report templates using an advanced drag-and-drop interface. These templates can be reused for generating reports.
- **Report Variables:** Define custom report variables and assign values to them. You can later use these variables within your report.
- **Data Sources:** Enter the details of your Grafana and Kibana instance to establish a connection. Refer to the [documentation](https://www.datavire.com/documentation/requirements) for supported Grafana and Kibana versions.
- **Distribution Channels:** Set up distribution channels such as email services (Gmail, SMTP, and others), Slack, Microsoft Teams, and WhatsApp. Configure and connect your preferred channels to seamlessly distribute reports.
- **Filter Queries:** Configure custom filters using queries and variables. Assign these filters to your reports to generate multiple reports based on each query.
- **Generation History:** Regularly review and preview all previously generated reports.
